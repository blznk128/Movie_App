Welcome to The Movie App! This app allows a user to search for any movie. The user can kick it up a notch by registering, allowing the user to save movies to their own account!

<h1>Demo instructions</h1>

You can search for any movie by entering the movie name in the search field and clicking the search icon. Once the search icon is clicked,
the movie will populate under the search field. The name of the movie will pop up, along with a poster and summary. Also a save button will 
appear and you can save that movie to their account to view later. To save a movie, you must register for a account first. To create a account, click register and fill out the fields, then it will redirect you to the log in page. Fill out your credentials and then log in, it will take you to the main page and your username will population. You can click on "My Saved Movies" to show the movies you have saved, where you can also delete them.

<h1>Tech used</h1>

Html, Css/materialize, javascript, express, express-session, node, sequelize.

<h1>My thoughts</h1>

This is my first app that uses session. It was tricky because I kept losing my user session when I switched pages. Session was really fun to work with, it was challenging but being able to log in and out almost brought a tear to my eye. I enjoy learning new tech every single day.

<h1>Future plans</h1>

I want to create a additional table so users can have multiple movies saved under their account. I also want to implement a "where to buy" button so the user can shop around for that movie. I want to do some more research and figure out why certain movie titles, like "lord of the rings" makes my app go bananas.
